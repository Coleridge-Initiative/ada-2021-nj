    "\n",
    "What should you do when you encounter missing values in your data? Unfortunately, there is usually no *right* answer. However, different decisions on how to address missing values can have different implications on the inferences you draw from any analysis. One option is to omit observations that have missing values, but you may also choose to retain all observations and instead impute these missing values using various techniques. Imputation provides your best guess for each missing point's true value. Here, you will learn how to implement common imputation methods for missing data and how those methods affect outcome measures and inferences.\n",

    "In this notebook, you will focus on 2012-13 New Jersey graduates' earnings during their first year after graduation. The notebook provides demonstrations using the first quarter after graduation and you will replicate using the fourth quarter. Recall that in the [Data Exploration](2.Dataset_Exploration.ipynb) notebook, you initially examined the earnings distribution for all members of this cohort who had positive earnings in this time period in New Jersey. To evaluate the earnings outcomes of all 2012-13 New Jersey graduates, you need to decide what to do when you cannot find their earnings in the New Jersey Unemployment Insurance (UI) wage records. A person may not appear in New Jersey's UI wage records for several reasons:\n",
    "- The person is unemployed. \n",
    "- The person is out of labor force, e.g., schooling, childcare, etc...\n",
    "- The person was employed outside of New Jersey.\n",
    "- The person's job is not covered in UI wage records, e.g.,self-employed, independent contractors, federal government works, etc. <a href='https://www.nap.edu/read/10206/chapter/11#294'>(Hotz and Scholz, 2002)</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "You will explore the resulting earnings outcomes after applying different earnings imputation methods. The methods covered in this notebook include:\n",
    "- Dropping all \"missing\" values\n",
    "- Filling in zero for people who do not have records in New Jersey UI wage records data \n",
    "- Substituting missing values with the average earnings of people who are in the same degree fields and have the same gender\n",
    "- Regression imputation"

    "\n",
    "For example, if we had cases where the data on earnings of some graduates was completely missing, we could approximate their earnings by referring to other characteristics which could be shared by major group (their 'closest neighbors' in terms of characteristics).\n",

    "The algorithm calculates the distance between the input values (the missing values) and helps to identify the nearest possible value based on other features (such as known characteristics of the closest major group). Imputing missing data using machine learning has become a research hotbed, and there are plenty of papers covering the various algorithms if you are curious."
