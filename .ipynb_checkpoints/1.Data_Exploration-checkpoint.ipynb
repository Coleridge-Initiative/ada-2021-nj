    "## **1. Introduction**\n",
    "Historically, state agencies used their own administrative data to administer programs and complete required reporting. These data were siloed and were not leveraged to evaluate or inform policy development within or across agencies. Legal, technological, and human resource barriers prevented using data to assist policymakers in making decisions. Through a concerted effort supported by the Statewide Longitudinal Data System (SLDS) Grant Program, states have gradually come together to address this limitation. In this course, you will learn how to review, understand, and link data from different agencies. You will also uncover real-life problems in using the data (such as missing data, errors in the data, and complex data structures) and learn how to address them. "

    "This notebook introduces you to the concept of creating a group or a \"cohort\" that will be used for future analysis. We will construct measures to understand who we are including and excluding (coverage) from the cohort and walk you through the decisions that need to be made when constructing the cohort using filters such as institution governance and/or level (in terms of highest degree offered), award level, major, and others. We begin with introducing you to the data analytical tools to load the data, including connecting R to the database and using SQL queries to pull the data. We then use these tools to explore completions files from the NJ Office of the Secretary of Higher Education. We will create a dataset (called a \"data frame\") and investigate the trends in New Jersey postsecondary graduates. At the end of this notebook, we will save the summary statistics in csv files that will be used in subsequent notebooks."

    "This course will not address the COVID-19 crisis that most states are facing. While some states have access to weekly claims data, in most states it takes time for data to work through business processes before data are available to reserachers. For New Jersey, outcomes data (unemployment claims and wage data), aren't posted to the data system until six months after a quarter ends. Higher education completions data aren't posted until eight months after academic year ends. These correspond to the data collection windows for reporting to the Federal government. Additionally, when someone graduates with a credential from a postsecondary institution, there is a time delay before an analyst can see an outcome (2 to 4 quarters after graduation). As such, analysts must consider these limitations when designing an analysis. Statistics and data visualizations from this course can serve as a baseline for future analysis on COVID-19. Once designed, the same analysis can be repeated over time to show changes pre- and post-COVID-19."

    "The Applied Data Analytics training uses a project-based approach to develop your analytic skills. You will begin by working with your team to develop and refine a research question. A crucial part of this is data exploration. You will implement techniques using SQL and R to explore and better understand the data that are available to you and if addressing your question is feasible. This will form the basis of all the other types of analyses you will do in this class and is a crucial first step for any data analysis workflow. As you work through the notebook, we will have checkpoints for you to practice writing code by making small adjustments, but you can also think about how you might apply any of the techniques and code presented with other datasets to address your research question. \n",

The exploration of the supply side of the labor market will later be supplemented by an analysis of the demand side to enhance our understanding of the overall labor market.\n",
